  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.3, 6.5_

- [ ] 11. Write comprehensive tests for image functionality
  - Create unit tests for file validation functions
  - Write integration tests for API routes with mock file uploads
  - Add tests for database operations and error scenarios
  - Implement end-to-end tests for complete upload workflow
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 12. Integrate authentication and authorization
